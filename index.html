          <p>
            4th year computer science student with an ever-progressing knowledge
            in computer science. Although I love technology, my journey actually started
            with majoring in psychology. Now, I aim to balance technology with human
            interaction for the perfect balance! The tech field is fluid and always changing,
            so I try to do the same! I value growth, which makes computer science one of the
            best fields to continously challange myself and learn. One day, I hope to be a software engineer for a leading tech company.

          <h3>Coffee</h3>
          <p>
            I'm super big into coffee, it's what keeps me running during semesters!
            Recently, I've started to learn more about how to make everyone's favorite
            cappuccinos and lattes! It turns out that latte art is pretty difficult, 
            though it won't cruch my dream of owning a tiny cafe one day.
          </p>
          <h3>Gym</h3>
          <p>
            Since I'm always clicking away on a keyboard, I've taken up the gym as a 
            way to stay more healthy! I've been at it for almost a year now, so it's
            pretty much a part of my routine! I'm definetly not a professional, but
            I've been enjoying the journey, and can't wait for that two year
            transformation everyone talks about!
